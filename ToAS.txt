sigh starch lord is the most overrated card in the
entire game. I can't stand it when people think 
starch lord is good. You guys, this is a 4 cost card
 that has 2 attack and 4 health. It has garbage 
stats. Now let's look at it's abilities. When you 
play a root, it gets +1/+1. Thats almost no- think 
about it. In order to get this up to the actual 
stats that it needs to be as a 4 cost card, this 
would have to buff like 2 roots just to break even.
It would have to grow 3 roots to actually be viable.
The fact that people think that it is a good idea 
to start drawing cards on turn 5, it really means 
you have no idea how to play pvz heroes. It's way 
too late! This is- it's- you dont make a deck that 
has roots in it, that's not a good strategy, there 
are some good roots in the game but you just have 
to put too many roots in it. It's drawing cards on 
turn 5, the last turn you're gonna be drawing cards
as a plant player is going to be on turn 3. it's so overrated, it's just a big piece of trash, just look at this guy, a big ugly guy. it's based on by the way the worst Marvel superhero in the entire Marvel Fra- actually universe of Superheroes in the entire history of the planet, star-lord, who is a simp, douchebag, has no superpowers, is the lamest, dumb. and do you know what, it's appropriate cuz this is the stupidest card in the game and it's based on the stupidest Marvel superhero ever. This is so overrated, It's so grunts it's so, I'm sticking this in F tier I don't even care.
